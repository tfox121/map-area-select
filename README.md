##3 basic maps to demonstrate:
1) Drawable polygons with edit and delete functionality. Overlapping
vectors prohibited. Polygons saved in state and displayed on right side.

2) Drawing polygons from state which can be edited and removed with
changes reflected in state.

3) Single marker placement which can determine whether the marker is
within one of the polygons held within state or not.
